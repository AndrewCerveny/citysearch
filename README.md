# Overview
The purpose of this application is to enable users to compare two cities, specifically the current city they reside in compared to one they may be considering moving to. Once a starting city and desired city are selected, a user will be taken to the results page where both cities wil be listed side by side with their quality of life catergories and rating on a scale 1-5 with 5 being the best.
